/**
 * Phase: parse
 *
 * Chunked parse + resolve loop: reads source in byte-budget chunks,
 * parses via worker pool (or sequential fallback), resolves imports,
 * heritage, and calls, synthesizes wildcard bindings.
 *
 * This phase encapsulates the entire `runChunkedParseAndResolve` function
 * from the original pipeline. The chunk loop is a memory optimization
 * internal to this phase, not a phase boundary.
 *
 * @deps    structure, markdown, cobol
 * @reads   scannedFiles, allPaths, totalFiles (from structure)
 * @writes  graph (Symbol nodes, IMPORTS/CALLS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS/ACCESSES edges)
 * @output  exportedTypeMap, allFetchCalls, allExtractedRoutes, allDecoratorRoutes,
 *          allToolDefs, allORMQueries, bindingAccumulator
